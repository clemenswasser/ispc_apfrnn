# ispc_apfrnn

All-pairs fixed-radius nearest neighbor search in 3D. It's a faster drop-in
alternative to [CompactNSearch] and [TreeNSearch] for SPH-style workloads,
built from ISPC kernels and TBB parallelism. The main consumer is learnsph.

## Layout

```
include/apfrnn/
  neighbor_search.hpp   NSearch: the public API (the only public header)
src/
  neighbor_search.cpp   set/pair state, caching, run() phases, skin filtering
  plan.{hpp,cpp}        strategy selection: which writer, ranges, capacities
  sweep.{hpp,cpp}       sweep backend for extremely sparse sets
  apfrnn.{hpp,cpp}      grid build, cell ranges, fixed-row/CSR writers
  kernels/              SIMD kernels (ISPC, no raw intrinsics):
    common.isph         structs shared with C++, cell keys, hash lookup
    cells.ispc          candidate cells and point ranges per query cell
    rows.ispc           fixed-capacity row writers
    csr.ispc            exact CSR count and write passes
    sync.ispc           coordinate sync from the caller's xyz
  sycl/                 optional static SYCL GPU backend
support/                synthetic scenes and VTK loader shared by tests/bench
tests/                  doctest suite (brute-force comparisons)
bench/                  Google Benchmark suite (Frame/, Threads/, Api/)

## Usage

```cpp
#include <apfrnn/neighbor_search.hpp>

apfrnn::NSearch search(radius);
const int fluid = search.add_point_set(fluid_xyz, fluid_count);
const int boundary =
    search.add_point_set(boundary_xyz, boundary_count, /*is_static=*/true);

search.set_all_searches(false);
search.set_active_search(fluid, fluid);
search.set_active_search(fluid, boundary);

search.run();

for (uint32_t j : search.get_neighbors(fluid, boundary, i)) {
  // j is an index into the boundary set's original order
}
```

- `add_point_set` keeps a pointer to the caller's interleaved `xyz` buffer
  (float or double). The buffer must stay alive. If it reallocates or
  changes size, call `resize_point_set` with the new pointer.
- `run()` re-reads dynamic sets every time. Static sets are cached until they
  are resized or toggled with `set_point_set_static`.
- `set_skin(s)` builds lists with `radius + s` and reuses them while no point
  has moved more than `s / 2` from the positions they were built at.
  `get_neighbors` still returns exact-radius lists.
- `set_memory_budget(bytes)` caps one row allocation (default 3 GiB). When a
  fixed-row table does not fit, the cross writer uses a compact per-row block
  layout before falling back to CSR rows.
- `last_stats()` reports build, grid, same-set and cross-set timings, row
  mode and memory.

### Consuming from CMake

```cmake
add_subdirectory(path/to/ispc_apfrnn ispc_apfrnn EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
target_link_libraries(my_target PRIVATE ispc_apfrnn_kernels)
```

The parent project must enable the ISPC language and provide TBB. Tests and
benchmarks are only built when this repository is the top-level project.

## Build

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DAPFRNN_BUILD_BASELINES=ON
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

| Option | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `APFRNN_BUILD_TESTS` | top-level | doctest suite |
| `APFRNN_BUILD_BENCHMARKS` | top-level | Google Benchmark targets |
| `APFRNN_BUILD_BASELINES` | `OFF` | fetches CompactNSearch/TreeNSearch |
| `APFRNN_ENABLE_SYCL` | `OFF` | static SYCL GPU backend, requires icpx |

## Optional SYCL GPU backend

```sh
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
cmake --preset sycl-release
cmake --build --preset sycl-release
```

```cpp
search.set_search_backend(apfrnn::SearchBackend::GpuExact);
search.set_search_backend(apfrnn::SearchBackend::Auto);
```

`APFRNN_BACKEND=cpu|gpu|auto` preselects the backend. GPU results are
set-equal to CPU results.

### GPU frame times

Earlier SYCL build; its CPU column is not the current CPU table.

<!-- bench:gpu:start -->
| Scene | CPU | GPU | Auto | GPU / CPU |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| uniform, 1M | 31.9 ms | 19.9 ms | 19.0 ms | 1.60x |
| uniform, 200k | 5.62 ms | 4.67 ms | 4.73 ms | 1.20x |
| SPH-like slab, 200k | 7.16 ms | 5.84 ms | 5.88 ms | 1.23x |
| uniform, 50k | 1.19 ms | 2.03 ms | 1.20 ms | 0.59x |
| surface, 200k | 15.0 ms | 19.0 ms | 15.6 ms | 0.79x |
| clustered, 200k | 24.8 ms | 34.4 ms | 24.8 ms | 0.72x |
| thin pipe, 200k | 107 ms | 104 ms* | 106 ms | 0.97x* |
| learnsph wall | 3.41 ms | 2.25 ms | 3.42 ms | 1.52x |
| learnsph bowl | 3.28 ms | 2.05 ms | 3.29 ms | 1.60x |

\* Falls back to the CPU because the output exceeds `APFRNN_SYCL_MAX_OUTPUT_MB`.

## Benchmarks

```sh
./scripts/bench.sh build
./scripts/bench_tables.py --write
./build/bench/ispc_apfrnn_bench --benchmark_filter='^Stress/'
./build/bench/ispc_apfrnn_bench --benchmark_filter='^Api/'
```

`scripts/bench_tables.py` runs the matrix, regenerates the tables above and
updates `README.md`. Review the `git diff`: a changed row is the measured
delta for the commit. `--check` verifies the tables without rewriting them.
Pass `--gpu-json <json>` from a SYCL run to regenerate the separate GPU table.

## Development

```sh
./scripts/ci.sh
./scripts/coverage.sh
./scripts/profile.sh build 50000
./scripts/ispc_analyze.sh
```
